# Nashville Housing Project
In this project, I will perform **data cleaning** on a dataset using SQL (MySQL) by completing the following tasks::
1. Create a table to import the dataset
2. Standardize the date format
3. Handle missing values
4. Standardize the data  
5. Remove Duplicates using various methods (CTE, JOINS and NESTED queries)
6. Drop Unused Columns
